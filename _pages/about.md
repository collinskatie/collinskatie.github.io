Hi, I'm Katie! I'm a Machine Learning PhD candidate in the [Computational and Biological Learning (CBL) Lab](http://learning.eng.cam.ac.uk/Public/) at the University of Cambridge, where I am supervised by [Adrian Weller MBE](http://mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk/adrian/) and advised by [Richard Turner](http://cbl.eng.cam.ac.uk/Public/Turner/WebHome). I am also a Student Fellow at the [Leverhulme Centre for the Future of Intelligence (CFI)](http://lcfi.ac.uk/) and volunteer with the [Human-Oriented Automated Theorem Proving](https://gowers.wordpress.com/2022/04/28/announcing-an-automatic-theorem-proving-project/), led by [Sir Tim Gowers](https://www.dpmms.cam.ac.uk/~wtg10/). I am grateful to the [Marshall Scholarship](https://www.marshallscholarship.org/), King's College, and the Cambridge Trust for additional funding support for my studies.

I'm particularly excited about scalable trustworthy machine learning, probabilistic modeling, and data-efficient human-machine teaming. I maintain a keen interest in computational cognitive science, stemming from my undergraduate research with [Josh Tenenbaum](http://web.mit.edu/cocosci/josh.html) (with whom I happily enjoy continue collaborating!).

I recently completed an MPhil in Machine Learning and Machine Intelligence from the University of Cambridge and obtained a Bachelors of Science from MIT in 2021 in Brain and Cognitive Sciences, with minors in Computer Science and Biomedical Engineering. During my undergrad, I founded the [MITxHarvard Women in AI Group](https://mitharvardwai.github.io/) in an effort to bringing more diverse voices to the table in AI! 

Outside of research, I love to run (!) and used to run competitively for MIT.
