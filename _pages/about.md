Hi, I'm Katie! As of Jan 2026, I'll be a Postdoctoral Fellow in the [Computational Cognitive Science Group](https://cocosci.mit.edu/) at MIT working with Josh Tenenbaum (funded by an [NSF SBE SPRF](https://www.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/sprf-sbe-postdoctoral-research-fellowships)) and a Visiting Postdoc at the [Princeton AI Lab](https://ai.princeton.edu/ai-lab) with Tom Griffiths. I am also a Research Affiliate at the [Centre for Human-Inspired AI](https://www.chia.cam.ac.uk/) at the University of Cambridge.

I am particularly interested in how people (and machines -- and people and machines together) reason about novel systems of rules and reward. So much of our lives involves systems of rules and reward, from our jobs, to institutions, sports, mathematics, and more. How do people flexibly navigate such a wide range of social systems and problems? How do we determine [what is worth thinking about](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11503), with whom, and determine not only how to make decisions about new systems, but [create new systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10914) and problems to solve? 

These questions are important not only to understand the flexibility of human cognition and strategic reasoning, entrepeneurship, and innovation -- but how we may design, develop, evaluate, deploy, and re-design [AI thought partners](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-024-01991-9) that too may change the systems that we think about, the "games" we play. What does it take to build AI systems that meet our expectations and complement our limitations, that we can engage with in ways that preserve and amplify human agency (and even the fun that can come from thinking deeply!) I am passionate about building out an **applied computational cognitive science**, putting models from computational cognitive science to work to inform developments in AI and other fields (e.g., biomedicine, mathematics, education) --- and in turn, coupling computational and mathematical modeling with empirical studies (especially via through the medium of games, broadly construed) to help us better understand people. 

Previously, I did my PhD at the University of Cambridge in Engineering in the [Computational and Biological Learning (CBL) Lab](http://learning.eng.cam.ac.uk/Public/) with Adrian Weller at King's College and spent time as a Student Researcher at Google DeepMind, Student Fellow at the [Leverhulme Centre for Future Intelligence (CFI)](https://www.lcfi.ac.uk/), and was a Research Affiliate at the [Human-Style Automated Theorem Proving Group](https://wtgowers.github.io/human-style-atp/) with Sir Tim Gowers. I received an MPhil in Machine Learning and Machine Intelligence from the University of Cambridge in 2022, a Bachelors of Science from MIT in Brain and Cognitive Sciences in 2021. I am grateful to the [Marshall Scholarship](https://www.marshallscholarship.org/) for funding my MPhil and PhD, as well as King's College, and the Cambridge Trust for additional support. I am passionate about interdisciplinary efforts in AI and the behavioral sciences and have helped co-organize multiple workshops: the [NeurIPS 2024 Workhops on Behavioral Machine Learning](https://sites.google.com/view/behavioralml/), [COGGRAPH at CogSci 2024](https://coggraph.github.io/), the [NeurIPS 2023 Math-AI Workshop](https://mathai2023.github.io/) and the [ICML 2022 Workshop on Human-Machine Collaboration and Teaming](https://sites.google.com/view/icml-2022-hmcat/home). During my undergrad, I founded the [MITxHarvard Women in AI Group](https://mitharvardwai.github.io/).

Outside of research, I love to run (!) and used to run competitively for MIT.
