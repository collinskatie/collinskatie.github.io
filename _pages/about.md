Hi, I'm Katie! I'm a Machine Learning PhD candidate in the [Computational and Biological Learning (CBL) Lab](http://learning.eng.cam.ac.uk/Public/) at the University of Cambridge, where I am supervised by [Adrian Weller MBE](http://mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk/adrian/) and advised by [Richard Turner](http://cbl.eng.cam.ac.uk/Public/Turner/WebHome). I collaborate closely [Josh Tenenbaum](http://web.mit.edu/cocosci/josh.html) and the [Computational Cognitive Science Group](https://cocosci.mit.edu/) at MIT. I am also a Student Fellow at the [Leverhulme Centre for the Future of Intelligence (CFI)](http://lcfi.ac.uk/) and volunteer with the [Human-Oriented Automated Theorem Proving](https://gowers.wordpress.com/2022/04/28/announcing-an-automatic-theorem-proving-project/), led by [Sir Tim Gowers](https://www.dpmms.cam.ac.uk/~wtg10/). Presently, I am also a part-time Student Researcher at [Google DeepMind](https://research.google/) with [Krishnamurthy (Dj) Dvijotham](https://dj-research.netlify.app/) and [Miltos Allamanis](https://miltos.allamanis.com/).

I'm particularly excited about two prongs: 1) bridging "the gap" between human and AI problem-solving, decision-making, and reasoning, and 2) *leveraging* this gap. The former (1) revolves around bringing AI systems closer to humans in their ability to learn from little data and handle (and propose) entirely new problems reliably - or at least express uncertainty when they can't. The latter (2), however, emphasizes the perhaps *advantageous* differences between humans and AI systems; humans are not perfect. I am especially excited about designing AI assistive systems which complement human strengths + weaknesses to push the fronteirs of human producivity, wellbeing, and discovery. Both prongs require characterizing what such "gaps" even are! Across these efforts, I work with amazing collaborators expanding + applying the toolkit of computational cognitive science, especially (increasingly) probabilistic programming, and studying foundation models and their interactions with humans.

I recently completed an MPhil in Machine Learning and Machine Intelligence from the University of Cambridge and obtained a Bachelors of Science from MIT in 2021 in Brain and Cognitive Sciences, with minors in Computer Science and Biomedical Engineering. I am grateful to the [Marshall Scholarship](https://www.marshallscholarship.org/) for funding my MPhil and PhD, as well as King's College, and the Cambridge Trust for additional support. During my undergrad, I founded the [MITxHarvard Women in AI Group](https://mitharvardwai.github.io/) in an effort to bringing more diverse voices to the table in AI! I have since enjoyed co-organizing other AI community efforts, including the [NeurIPS 2023 Math-AI Workshop](https://mathai2023.github.io/) and the [ICML 2022 Workshop on Human-Machine Collaboration and Teaming](https://sites.google.com/view/icml-2022-hmcat/home).

Outside of research, I love to run (!) and used to run competitively for MIT.
