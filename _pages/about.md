Hi, I'm Katie! I'm a Machine Learning PhD candidate in the [Computational and Biological Learning (CBL) Lab](http://learning.eng.cam.ac.uk/Public/) at the University of Cambridge, where I am supervised by [Adrian Weller MBE](http://mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk/adrian/) and advised by [Richard Turner](http://cbl.eng.cam.ac.uk/Public/Turner/WebHome), and visiting student with [Josh Tenenbaum](http://web.mit.edu/cocosci/josh.html) and the [Computational Cognitive Science Group](https://cocosci.mit.edu/) at MIT. I am also a Student Fellow at the [Leverhulme Centre for the Future of Intelligence (CFI)](http://lcfi.ac.uk/) and volunteer with the [Human-Oriented Automated Theorem Proving](https://gowers.wordpress.com/2022/04/28/announcing-an-automatic-theorem-proving-project/), led by [Sir Tim Gowers](https://www.dpmms.cam.ac.uk/~wtg10/). Previously, I was a part-time Student Researcher at [Google DeepMind](https://research.google/) with [Krishnamurthy (Dj) Dvijotham](https://dj-research.netlify.app/).

I am passionate about **applied computational cognitive science** and investigating human-AI interaction from the lense of cognitive science. In particular, I am interested in the study and design of [AI thought partners](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03943) that meet our expectations and complement our limitations, and do so by engaging deeply with the behavioral sciences. I am particularly motivated by applications in biomedicine, mathematics, and education, and ensuring that systems faithfully express, reason over, and communicate uncertainty. 

I received an MPhil in Machine Learning and Machine Intelligence from the University of Cambridge and a Bachelors of Science from MIT in Brain and Cognitive Sciences, with minors in Computer Science and Biomedical Engineering. I am grateful to the [Marshall Scholarship](https://www.marshallscholarship.org/) for funding my MPhil and PhD, as well as King's College, and the Cambridge Trust for additional support. I am passionate about interdisciplinary efforts in AI and the behavioral sciences and have helped co-organize multiple workshops: the [NeurIPS 2024 Workhops on Behavioral Machine Learning](https://sites.google.com/view/behavioralml/), [COGGRAPH at CogSci 2024](https://coggraph.github.io/), the [NeurIPS 2023 Math-AI Workshop](https://mathai2023.github.io/) and the [ICML 2022 Workshop on Human-Machine Collaboration and Teaming](https://sites.google.com/view/icml-2022-hmcat/home). During my undergrad, I founded the [MITxHarvard Women in AI Group](https://mitharvardwai.github.io/).

Outside of research, I love to run (!) and used to run competitively for MIT.
