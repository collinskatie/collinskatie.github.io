Hi, I'm Katie! I'm a [2021 Marshall Scholar](https://www.marshallscholarship.org/) and MPhil student in [Machine Learning and Machine Intelligence](https://www.postgraduate.study.cam.ac.uk/courses/directory/egegmpmsl) at the University of Cambridge, where I work primarily with [Adrian Weller](http://mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk/adrian/) in the [Computational and Biological Learning (CBL) Lab](http://learning.eng.cam.ac.uk/Public/) on trustworthy machine learning, probabilistic modeling, and data-efficient human-machine teaming. I am also excited to be collaborating on the [Human-Oriented Automated Theorem Proving](https://gowers.wordpress.com/2022/04/28/announcing-an-automatic-theorem-proving-project/) effort led by [Tim Gowers](https://www.dpmms.cam.ac.uk/~wtg10/). 

I recently graduated from MIT majoring in Brain and Cognitive Sciences, with minors in Computer Science and Biomedical Engineering, where I was supervised by [Josh Tenenbaum](http://web.mit.edu/cocosci/josh.html), along with many other amazing researchers and mentors such as [Vincent Sitzmann](https://www.vincentsitzmann.com/), [Kevin Smith](http://www.mit.edu/~k2smith/), [Tuan Anh Le](https://www.tuananhle.co.uk/), and [Bernhard Egger](https://eggerbernhard.ch/) in the [MIT Computational Cognitive Science Group](https://cocosci.mit.edu/), and was also advised by [Tomaso Poggio](https://mcgovern.mit.edu/profile/tomaso-poggio/) of the [Center for Brains, Minds, and Machines](https://cbmm.mit.edu/). Before that, I had the incredible opportunity to work at the intersection of machine learning and biomedical enginering with fantastic collaborators at the [Wyss Institute](https://wyss.harvard.edu/) at Harvard, the [MIT Center for Syntethic Biology](http://synbio.mit.edu/), and the [Broad Instiute](https://www.broadinstitute.org/). I am grateful to have received funding for some of my undergraduate research through a [Goldwater Scholarship](https://goldwaterscholarship.gov/) and the Johnson & Johnson UROP Scholars Program. 

I am also passionate about bringing more diverse voices to the table in AI and founded the [MITxHarvard Women in AI Group](https://mitharvardwai.github.io/). Likewise, I am keen to contribute to conversations around the implications of AI and helped develop new curricular materials for MIT's undergraduate machine learning courses as part of the MIT Case Studies in [Societal and Ethical Responsibilities of Computing (SERC)](https://computing.mit.edu/cross-cutting/social-and-ethical-responsibilities-of-computing/).
