Hi, I'm Katie! I'm a [2021 Marshall Scholar](https://www.marshallscholarship.org/) and a first-year Machine Learning PhD candidate in the Dept. of Engineering at the University of Cambridge, where I am supervised by [Adrian Weller MBE](http://mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk/adrian/) and advised by [Richard Turner](http://cbl.eng.cam.ac.uk/Public/Turner/WebHome) in the [Computational and Biological Learning (CBL) Lab](http://learning.eng.cam.ac.uk/Public/) on trustworthy machine learning, probabilistic modeling, and data-efficient human-machine teaming. I am also a Student Fellow at the [Leverhulme Centre for the Future of Intelligence (CFI)](http://lcfi.ac.uk/) and am closely involved in an exciting collaborative effort on [Human-Oriented Automated Theorem Proving](https://gowers.wordpress.com/2022/04/28/announcing-an-automatic-theorem-proving-project/), led by [Sir Tim Gowers](https://www.dpmms.cam.ac.uk/~wtg10/). I am also thankful for support from [King's College Cambridge](https://www.kings.cam.ac.uk) and the [Cambridge Trust](https://www.cambridgetrust.org).

I recently completed an MPhil in [Machine Learning and Machine Intelligence](https://www.postgraduate.study.cam.ac.uk/courses/directory/egegmpmsl) from the University of Cambridge. I received my Bachelors of Science from MIT in 2021 where I majored in Brain and Cognitive Sciences with minors in Computer Science and Biomedical Engineering, and was supervised by [Josh Tenenbaum](http://web.mit.edu/cocosci/josh.html) and advised by [Tomaso Poggio](https://mcgovern.mit.edu/profile/tomaso-poggio/). I've also had the pleasure of working with many other fantastic researchers and mentors in the [MIT Computational Cognitive Science Group](https://cocosci.mit.edu/) such as [Vincent Sitzmann](https://www.vincentsitzmann.com/), [Kevin Smith](http://www.mit.edu/~k2smith/), [Tuan Anh Le](https://www.tuananhle.co.uk/), [Bernhard Egger](https://eggerbernhard.ch/), and [Cathy Wong](https://web.mit.edu/zyzzyva/www/academic.html). 

Before that, I had the incredible opportunity to work at the intersection of machine learning and biomedical enginering with great collaborators at the [Wyss Institute](https://wyss.harvard.edu/) at Harvard, the [MIT Center for Syntethic Biology](http://synbio.mit.edu/), and the [Broad Instiute](https://www.broadinstitute.org/). I am grateful to have received funding for some of my undergraduate research through a [Goldwater Scholarship](https://goldwaterscholarship.gov/) and the Johnson & Johnson UROP Scholars Program. 

I am also passionate about bringing more diverse voices to the table in AI and founded the [MITxHarvard Women in AI Group](https://mitharvardwai.github.io/). Likewise, I am keen to contribute to conversations around the implications of AI and helped develop new curricular materials for MIT's undergraduate machine learning courses as part of the MIT Case Studies in [Societal and Ethical Responsibilities of Computing (SERC)](https://computing.mit.edu/cross-cutting/social-and-ethical-responsibilities-of-computing/).

Outside of research, I love to run! I [ran competitively](https://mitathletics.com/sports/womens-track-and-field/roster/katie-collins/9917) while at MIT.
